# vita2hos
A PlayStation Vita to Horizon OS (Nintendo Switch OS) translation layer (**not** an emulator)

### How does it work?

PlayStation Vita (ARMv7 CPU) executables can be run natively on Nintendo Switch ARMv8 CPU in 32-bit execution mode.
When loading a PlayStation Vita executable, _vita2hos_ redirects the [module](https://wiki.henkaku.xyz/vita/Modules) imports of said executable to jump to routines that implement the same behavior, by using native Horizon OS services, like the one exposed by the original PlayStation Vita OS modules.
